## BUG-2: OrderRequest schema lacks `metadata` field — CRITICAL (was)

**Fix:** Added `metadata: dict = Field(default_factory=dict)` to `OrderRequest` in `shared/schemas.py`.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## BUG-3: `check_position_size` always approves — HIGH (was)

**Fix:** Changed comparison from tautological `estimated_value > total_equity` to `signal.strength * total_equity > total_equity * max_pct`. Added `test_rejects_oversized` test.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## ARCH-1: DB password not URL-encoded — HIGH (was)

**Fix:** Added `urllib.parse.quote_plus()` for user and password in `db/session.py` `_build_url()`.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## BUG-4: Router logs "FILLED" for non-sim PLACED orders — MEDIUM (was)

**Fix:** Split log path — checks `order.status == FILLED` before logging fill details. Live PLACED orders now log "PLACED" with correct info.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## BUG-5: Backtest `close` field has no mapping — LOW (was)

**Fix:** Added `"close": "Close"` to `col_to_field` in `backtest/engine.py`.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## BUG-6: Reconciler broken in multi-session mode — MEDIUM (was)

**Fix:** Added `session_id` param to `Reconciler.__init__()`, uses `_session_channel()` for Redis key. Also documented that reconciler is not wired into V2 SessionPipeline (legacy only).
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## ERR-1: Silent `pass` on Redis state refresh failure — HIGH (was)

**Fix:** Replaced `except: pass` with `logger.warning()` including exc_info in `risk/manager.py` `_refresh_portfolio_state()`.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## CONC-1: SimulationAdapter state not thread-safe — HIGH (was)

**Fix:** Added `asyncio.Lock` guarding `_cash`, `_positions`, `_last_prices` in both `_on_price_update` and `place_order` in `execution/sim_adapter.py`.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## CQ-1: Duplicate `ValidationResult` class — MEDIUM (was)

**Fix:** Extracted `ValidationResult` dataclass to `shared/schemas.py`. Both `strategy/validator_v2.py` and `strategy/custom_validator.py` now import from there.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## CQ-3: Dead code — `data/custom_data.py` — LOW (was)

**Fix:** Verified file is never imported anywhere. V2 uses `collector.load_custom_data_functions()` for dynamic custom data. Deleted the unused V1 file.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## CQ-4: Incorrect type hint — LOW (was)

**Fix:** Changed `alpaca_credentials: dict = None` to `dict | None = None` in `data/collector.py`.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## CQ-5: `RiskManager` class largely dead code in V2 — LOW (was)

**Fix:** Marked class as deprecated with docstring. Still used by V1 `scripts/run_execution.py` so not deleted — just clearly documented as legacy.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## ERR-2: Silent exception swallowing in `_publish_log` — MEDIUM (was)

**Fix:** Replaced `except Exception: pass` with `logger.debug(..., exc_info=True)` in `execution/router.py`, `risk/manager.py`, `portfolio/tracker.py`, and `session/manager.py` (collector stop + task cancellation).
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## ERR-3: `get_session_info` DB errors not caught — MEDIUM (was)

**Fix:** Wrapped DB query in `get_session_info()` with try/except, returns None on failure, logs exception. Prevents unhandled DB errors from crashing session start.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## ERR-4: No validation of yfinance `fast_info` return — LOW (was)

**Fix:** Added try/except around `ticker.fast_info` access in both `fetch()` and `fetch_history()`. Falls back to empty dict if `fast_info` returns None or raises (e.g. rate limiting).
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## PERF-1: N+1 API calls in yfinance source — HIGH (was)

**Fix:** Refactored `fetch()` to use `yf.download()` for batch price/OHLCV data (1 HTTP request for all symbols). Falls back to per-symbol `fast_info` on failure. Fundamentals still use individual `ticker.info` (no batch API).
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## PERF-2: N+1 order book requests in Binance source — MEDIUM (was)

**Fix:** Replaced serial per-symbol order book requests with `ThreadPoolExecutor` (max 10 workers) for concurrent fetching in `data/sources/binance_source.py`.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## PERF-3: Eager-loading all DB relationships — MEDIUM (was)

**Fix:** Changed `lazy="selectin"` to `lazy="select"` on all 4 TradingSession relationships (trades, positions, orders, equity_snapshots) in `db/models.py`. No code accesses these relationships on session objects.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## PERF-4: Auth session store never cleaned — LOW (was)

**Fix:** Added `cleanup_expired_sessions()` and amortized `_maybe_cleanup()` (every 5 min) called from `get_current_user()` in `monitoring/auth.py`. Expired tokens now pruned automatically.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## PERF-5: Log buffers grow per-session forever — LOW (was)

**Fix:** Added `cleanup_session_logs()` in `monitoring/logs.py` and called it from `session/manager.py` `delete_session()`. Removes log buffer and subscription tracking when a session is deleted.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## SEC-5: API keys exposed in session info API — HIGH (was)

**Fix:** Added `mask_secrets` parameter to `_session_to_dict()` and `get_session_info()`. API responses now show `"****" + last4` for api_key/api_secret. Internal `start_session` uses `mask_secrets=False` to get real keys.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## SEC-6: Session update accepts arbitrary `**kwargs` — MEDIUM (was)

**Fix:** Added whitelist of allowed update fields in `monitoring/sessions.py` PUT endpoint. Only `name`, `symbols`, `api_key`, `api_secret`, `testnet`, `starting_budget`, `strategy_code`, `data_config`, `custom_data_code` are accepted.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## SEC-7: Credential timing attack — LOW (was)

**Fix:** Replaced `==` with `hmac.compare_digest()` for both username and password comparison in `check_credentials()` in `monitoring/auth.py`.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## SEC-3: Plaintext credentials in config — HIGH (was)

**Fix:** Password `==` comparison already fixed by SEC-7 (hmac.compare_digest). Full bcrypt hashing and API key encryption deferred — accepted risk for personal-use system per original TODO assessment.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## SEC-4: Session cookie not `secure` — HIGH (was)

**Fix:** Added `secure=True` to `set_cookie()` in `monitoring/auth.py`. Cookie now only sent over HTTPS (Cloudflare tunnel provides this).
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## SEC-1: Strategy `exec()` sandbox is bypassable — CRITICAL (was)

**Fix:** Removed `type` from allowed builtins (prevents metaclass-based sandbox escapes). Documented remaining numpy.os reachability as accepted risk for personal-use system. Full isolation requires subprocess/Wasm sandboxing.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## SEC-2: Custom data `exec()` has no sandbox at all — CRITICAL (was)

**Fix:** Added `_custom_data_builtins()` in `data/collector.py` with restricted builtins — blocks eval/exec/compile, provides whitelist-based `__import__` (allows network libs like requests/urllib but blocks os/subprocess/sys).
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## ARCH-3: No CSRF protection — MEDIUM (was)

**Fix:** Added per-session CSRF tokens stored in auth sessions. CSRF middleware in `monitoring/app.py` validates `X-CSRF-Token` header on all POST/PUT/DELETE requests (except login). Token auto-injected into `base.html` meta tag and all `fetch()` calls via JS monkey-patch.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## ARCH-4: Single Redis connection shared across sessions — MEDIUM (was)

**Fix:** Changed `_listen()` in `shared/redis_client.py` to dispatch callbacks as `asyncio.create_task()` instead of awaiting sequentially. Slow subscribers no longer block other sessions' message processing.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## ARCH-5: No rate limiting on API endpoints — MEDIUM (was)

**Fix:** Added lightweight in-memory fixed-window rate limiter (`monitoring/rate_limit.py`). Configured per-route limits for expensive endpoints: backtest run (5/min), session CRUD (30/min), editor deploy (10/min), validation (20/min). Wired as outermost middleware in `monitoring/app.py`. No external dependencies.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## ARCH-6: Backtest blocks main thread pool — MEDIUM (was)

**Fix:** Changed `run_backtest_async()` in `backtest/engine.py` to use a dedicated `ThreadPoolExecutor` (max 2 workers) instead of the default thread pool. Added `asyncio.Semaphore` to cap concurrent backtests. Queued backtests log a waiting message.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## CONC-3: Redis `_listen` task never restarts on error — MEDIUM (was)

**Fix:** Added retry loop with exponential backoff (1s → 60s max) in `_listen()` in `shared/redis_client.py`. On reconnect, re-subscribes to all tracked channels. Only exits on `CancelledError` or normal pubsub close.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## BUG-14: `close` field returns yesterday's close across all sources — HIGH (was)

**Fix:** yfinance batch: changed `close` from `_prev_close(sym)` to `_col("Close", sym)`. yfinance fallback: changed from `prev_close` to `price`. Binance: changed from `prevClosePrice` to `lastPrice`. All three paths now return the current/latest close.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## BUG-15: Validator ALLOWED_IMPORTS doesn't match executor _IMPORT_WHITELIST — HIGH (was)

**Fix:** Added `datetime, decimal, typing, logging, pandas` to executor's `_IMPORT_WHITELIST` in `strategy/executor.py`. Now matches validator's `ALLOWED_IMPORTS`. All are safe (no I/O, no network).
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## BUG-16: Partial fill double-counting in PortfolioTracker — HIGH (was)

**Fix:** Added `_last_filled` dict tracking cumulative `filled_qty` per `order_id`. `_on_order_update` now computes `delta_qty = filled_qty - prev_filled` and only applies the incremental fill. Cleaned up on FILLED status. Prevents position quantity drift on partial fills from Binance/Alpaca.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## BUG-17: `_persist_order` queries by `external_id=None` for failed orders — HIGH (was)

**Fix:** Rewrote `_persist_order` in `execution/router.py` to use `order_id` (internal UUID) as primary lookup key instead of `external_id`. Fallback to `external_id` lookup for backward compat. Failed orders now always INSERT with `order_id`, never match other NULL rows.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## BUG-26: `avg_price` never persisted to DB on order updates — MEDIUM (was)

**Fix:** Added `avg_price` column to `Order` model in `db/models.py`. `_persist_order` now writes `avg_price` in both update and insert branches. Fixed alongside BUG-17.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## BUG-20: Binance `cancel_order` missing required `symbol` parameter — HIGH (was)

**Fix:** Added `_order_symbols` dict to `BinanceAdapter`, populated during `place_order`. `cancel_order` now looks up the symbol and passes it to the Binance API. Returns False with error log if symbol is unknown.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## BUG-21: Alpaca adapter blocks event loop with synchronous HTTP calls — HIGH (was)

**Fix:** Wrapped all 5 sync `TradingClient` calls in `await asyncio.to_thread()`: `submit_order`, `cancel_order_by_id`, `get_order_by_id`, `get_account`, `get_all_positions`. Event loop no longer blocks during Alpaca HTTP requests.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## BUG-27: `PnLCalculator.record_close` never called — realized P&L always 0 — MEDIUM (was)

**Fix:** Instantiated `PnLCalculator` in `PortfolioTracker.__init__`. `_on_order_update` now calls `_pnl.record_close()` on SELL fills with entry/exit prices and delta quantity. Published portfolio state now includes `realized_pnl`, `total_closed_trades`, and `win_rate` from P&L summary.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## BUG-18: Pipeline leak on `start_session` failure — HIGH (was)

**Fix:** In `start_session`'s except block, cancel all orphaned asyncio tasks on the pipeline and remove the pipeline from `self._pipelines` dict before setting error status. Prevents resource leaks from partially-created tasks (collector, router, portfolio tracker, sim price listener).
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## BUG-19: `update_session` silently ignores strategy/data config fields — HIGH (was)

**Fix:** Added handling for `strategy_code`, `data_config`, and `custom_data_code` in `update_session`. Dict/list values are JSON-serialized before storage; string values passed through as-is.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## BUG-22: Stale PubSub object reused after Redis connection failure — HIGH (was)

**Fix:** In `_listen()` retry loop, close the old PubSub object and create a fresh one via `self._redis.pubsub()` before re-subscribing. Prevents stale connection from causing infinite retry loops where no messages flow.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## BUG-23: `float("inf")` profit factor breaks JSON serialization — MEDIUM (was)

**Fix:** Replaced `float("inf")` with `9999.99` for profit factor when there are winning trades but zero losses. Prevents `json.dumps` from raising `ValueError` on backtest results.
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## BUG-24: Backtest `day_change_pct` field never computed — MEDIUM (was)

**Fix:** Added `prev_close` array to track previous bar's close per symbol. Computes `day_change_pct = (close - prev_close) / prev_close * 100` as a special case alongside `vwap`. Updates `prev_close` after each bar.
**Date:** 2026-03-26
